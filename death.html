                    <hr>
                    <p>The concept is based on the subject of accepting death and the grieving process after ones passing. The Legacy Stone is a two part experience created for cancer patients and their spouses. Part I is a hand imprinted interactive stone that utilizes Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) technology and sensors to improve the coping and grieving process, while bringing both parties closer together. Part II is a digital experience that allows patients to leave behind and share their memories with their spouses after their passing. </p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>I worked with Morgan Fritz an Industrial Design student at Carnegie Mellon University.  Together we developed the concept and solution, interviewed therapists, psychiatrist and cancer patients, and conducted usability research. I helped prototype the mold, and created the digital interface and prototype for patients to leave their memories in the future.</p>

                <p>The stones stimultaneously react through light patterns and vibrations relative to the way the other person is interacting with the stone. It helps partners be aware of each other’s presence without them having to physically be together.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>After talking to various therapists involved in cancer treatment, we found that empowering the patient to be able to leave memories for their spouses helpes them feel more in control of the situation, and come to peace with death.</p>
                </br>
                <p>Through the interface, patients can choose days in the future that will project memories to their spouses even after they pass away.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>Our initial project idea was inspired by the idea of coming to peace with death. We wanted to help people who were aware of their impending death to be able to overcome the fear of dying, and celebrate their lives. Through this project we tried to understand what makes people accepting of death, and how they can cope with it.</p>

                <p>We began our research by looking at different cultures and religions to understand how people cope with death around the world and historically.  We delved deeply into the five stages of grief, and talked to people who have lost loved ones to decipher what helps people grieve.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>We worked with Our Clubhouse, a cancer society dedicated to offering social, emotional and informational support to those in the Pittsburgh area touched by cancer.  We interviewed therapists, therapeutic artists, cancer patients, and individuals who have lost loved ones to gain a better understanding of what helps patients come to peace with death, and how we could help alleviate the grief. </p>

                <p>We chose to focus on cancer patients and their spouses under the age of fifty. Our audience includes people that are diagnosed with terminal cancer, so they have time to use The Legacy Stone. We chose the age  fifty because we wanted our users to be able to easily understand and openly accept the technology we were providing for them.</p>

                <p>It is widely used to treat distressing events, emotional disturbance and behaviors that will affect future situations.  We wanted to use this technology to help both the patient and their spouses during and after the passing of their loved one. </p>

                <hr>
                <p>Part II of our solution is for patients to leave a legacy to gain closure.  The patient can choose dates such as anniversaries or birhtdays they wish to insert memories. Memories include text, pictures, and videos, which will be pushed to their spouses phones or computers when the time comes.  It will be activated by the spouse after the passing.</p>

            <hr>
            <p>If we had better understanding of future technologies, we believe we could largely improve this product for the future. For instance, although we can currently sense the actions people use to interact with the stone, we wish it could recognize the persons mood and use technology surrounding them to better their emotions. Could we recognize a person’s depressive instinct and change light fixtures or sound surroundings to better their mood? The main challenge I see for a product like this is that humans react to death differently, and finding a product that people would want to use versus a product people would be skeptical about is difficult. We did not want to create negative triggers by leaving memories.</p>
