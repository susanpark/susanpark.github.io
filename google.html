                <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>I created a Garage Sale App for Google as a design exercise. I chose this prompt because I was intrigued by the challenge of designing an app that had multiple use casethes (seller & buyer). </p>

                <h3>ROLE</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>I created this app over the course of 5 days. I conducted user reasearch with interviews and competitive analysis. I designed the user flow, digital wireframes and high fidelity screens.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>I had never held my own garage sale in the past, and thought it would be an interesting challenge to tackle. I wanted to gain a solid understanding of what the problems of holding a garage sale was. I decided to target college students that were graduating who needed to get rid of their things. </p>
                </br>
                <p>I also did competitive analysis on various websites that dealt with providing a platform for people to buy and sell items such as Craigstlist and Etsy. I thought it would also be valuable to do competitive analysis on websites that helped users sell products at a competitive price such as StubHub and eBay. </p>

                <hr>
                <p>I always begin making wireframes in my sketchbook. For this project, I made all my product decisions here before going into the digital wireframes. There were five main problems I found from the interviews.</p>

                <p>(1) It is time consuming to post on various social media outlets. (2) There is big time pressure, and many students ended up giving away their things for free or threw them away. (3) Most people do not have the necessary transportation, which was one of the biggest factors people could not purchase items. (4) Even with transportation, often times, students would sell on Craigstlist and many people were far too away that it was not worth driving the product over. (5) It ishard to coordinate with people, especially when using various outlets to sell multiple items.</p>

                <p>I decided to use brown natural tones because a traditional garage sale is very human and authentic. Although I took a digital route to the solution, I didnâ€™t want the app itself to feel artificial.</p>

            <p>I think it would be valuable for this app to have been a web app because it would have provided users the ability to use this app without having to download it. In addition, with a web app, I could have used their search history to see what kind of furniture they were looking for. I think there could have been an easier way for users to be able to add a listing, rather than going to the search page to add a product. </p>
