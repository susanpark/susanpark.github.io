	    		<h3>What is it?</h3>
	    		<p>Buddha Bing is a restaurant that opened in Los Angeles in January 2015. At Buddha Bing, we believe fast food should be just as wholesome and fresh as home cooked meals. Our mission is to deliver a nostalgic Chinese street food made with the simplest and healthiest ingredients in a manner best resembling American Fast Food.</p>

	    		<h3>What did I do?</h3>
	    		<p>I am currently the Chief Design Officer, or Design Guru. I was initially brought on to re-brand the logo and brand. I am now in charge of design initiatives including brand, website, product packaging, food truck design, and restaurant interior design and any design aspects of the company products. This is an on-going project. </p>

	    	<h1>CONCEPT IDEATION</h1>
	    	<p>We want to popularize a traditional food in Beijing called Jian Bing. It is very commonly served in China, and is technically fast-food, but still healthy to eat. Buddha Bing is currently opened in an Asian populated area in Los Angeles. However, we want to expand to other parts of Southern California, and incorporate music and people of different cultures to help assimilate the different communities in LA.</p>

	    	<h1>LOGO & VISUAL</h1>
	    	<p>Buddha Bing is a food truck/restaurant, so we wanted the branding to resemble an atmostphere of a fast-food restaurant. We moved away from calmer and sophisticated or expensive looking visuals and decided to go with a bold illustration of Buddha similing. We are targeting groups of people of ages 15-30. Thus, we wanted Buddha Bing to have a hip LA food truck feel that would attract young adults, while still sticking to traditional Chinese type. This is why we decided to choose bold thick type, as you would see in Chinese typography. Below are some iterations of how I tried incorporate the text and image, and attempts to explore different colors.</p>

	    	<h1>FINAL DIRECTION</h1>
	    	<p>I chose to go with the orange color scheme with the large buddha face. I chose the orange color scheme because it was the most appetizing color scheme. The red and green were appetizing color schemes as well, but they were too bold and overpowering and took away from the Buddha logo. There is also a subtle sophistication to the toned down orange and brown colors we chose. </p>
