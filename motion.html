	    		<h3>Time, Motion & Communication</h3>
	    		<p>Dan Boyarski has been teaching a class called Time, Motion & Communication at Carnegie Mellon University for the past 30 years. We learn about the art of kinetic typography, as well as the fundamentals of motion graphics using Adobe After Effects.</p>

	    		<h3>After Effects</h3>
	    		<p>I have been interested in motion graphics and film since I was younger, but never got a chance to explore my capabilities until this class. These projects show the range of styles I can create.</p>

	    	<h1>Rhythm</h1>
	    	<p>We were to create a video that visualized the sound of the music we chose. I wanted to pick a piece that had an explosive and memorable beat. I chose Scriptina by Losco because it emphasizes the contrast of small noises and loud drops. I also wanted to incorporate animation of characters within the video. Krieger is one of my favorite characters from a show called Archer. He portrays an odd character who loves taking people apart to turn them into cyborgs. I wanted to progress from simple shapes to transform and use his face to explode and distort.</p>

		<div class="greysection">
	    	<h1>STORYBOARDING</h1>
	    	<p>I storyboarded many ideas in my moleskin before starting the video. I had to create the different pieces to explode individually. I drew most of the shapes out and converted them in illustrator. I colored them according to how they would look in a 3D space. I chose to keep all of my illustrations simple because I wanted to emphasize the explosions, and not draw attention to detail of the shapes. I also illustrated Krieger and Archer's face.</p>

	    	<h1>An Introduction</h1>
	    	<p>Zachary Bergeron is a student at Carnegie Mellon University. I wanted to introduce him in a light that not many people know him from. He is a very different person under his quiet and more serious facade. I wanted to use this video to also encourage him to pursue what he has wanted to do for a while, but does not have the courage to.</p>

	    	<h1>Kinetic Typography</h1>
	    	<p>Kinetic and moving typography is an important aspect of motion graphics. I chose Leonardo DiCaprio's monologue from The Wolf of Wall Street and used only typography to visualize his speech.</p>
